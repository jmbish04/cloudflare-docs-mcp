**Branch:** `feature/vision-refactor`
**Pull Request:** [https://github.com/jmbish04/cloudflare-docs-mcp/pull/8](https://github.com/jmbish04/cloudflare-docs-mcp/pull/8)

## Summary of Work

My primary contribution was a significant architectural refactor to move the worker towards a true agent-based model. This involved creating dedicated, typed tool classes for interacting with external services and rewriting the core `ChatSessionActor` to consume these tools in a structured, multi-step process.

### Detailed Contributions:

1.  **New Tool Scaffolding:**
    *   Created `src/tools/browser.ts`: A dedicated client class (`BrowserRender`) for interacting with the Cloudflare Browser Rendering API.
    *   Created `src/tools/sandbox.ts`: A dedicated client class (`SandboxTool`) for interacting with the `@cloudflare/sandbox` API, enabling sandboxed code execution and file system operations.

2.  **Actor Refactoring (`ChatSessionActor.ts`):**
    *   **Removed Old `ToolService`:** The previous, flawed tool service was deleted.
    *   **Rewrote `ChatSessionActor`:** The actor was completely rewritten to function as a stateful agent.
    *   **Tool Instantiation:** The actor now instantiates its own dedicated tools (`GitHubTool`, `BrowserRender`, `SandboxTool`, `StructuredResponseTool`) in its constructor.
    *   **Agentic Workflow:** The `handleUserQuery` method was refactored to follow a proper agent loop:
        1.  **Plan:** Generate a research plan using the `structuredResponseTool`.
        2.  **Execute:** Run the specific tool calls (`github_api`, `browser`, `sandbox`, etc.) identified in the plan.
        3.  **Synthesize:** Generate a final, comprehensive answer based on the collected results from the tool executions.

3.  **Commit and Push:**
    *   All changes were committed with the message: `feat: Implement core data pathways and agent orchestration`.
    *   The commit was **force-pushed** to the `feature/vision-refactor` branch, updating the associated pull request (#8).
