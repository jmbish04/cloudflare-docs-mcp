# Product Vision & Requirements

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product vision, requirements, and strategic goals for the **Cloudflare AI Research Assistant Worker**. Its purpose is to serve as a guiding star for all development, ensuring that every feature and architectural decision aligns with the core mission.

## 2. The Problem

Cloudflare's ecosystem is powerful but vast and often nuanced. Developers, both human and AI, frequently encounter challenges that fall into several categories:
*   **Nuanced Implementations:** Official documentation provides the "what," but often lacks the "how" for complex, real-world scenarios (e.g., setting up a Next.js application on Workers + Pages with specific SSR configurations).
*   **"Gotchas" and Best Practices:** Many hard-won lessons and best practices are scattered across blog posts, community forums, and individual developer knowledge, but are not centralized.
*   **Verification Gap:** Proposed solutions and code snippets are often theoretical. There is no immediate way to verify if a solution is correct without a full development setup, leading to time-consuming trial and error.
*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** Generic search tools lack the ability to understand the full context of a developer's problem, leading to irrelevant or incomplete answers.

## 3. The Vision

We will build a **specialized, context-aware AI Research Assistant** that acts as an expert Cloudflare co-pilot.

This assistant will not just search for information; it will **understand, consult, research, verify, and synthesize** information to provide comprehensive, actionable "information packages" that empower AI developers to solve complex problems efficiently. It will be the go-to resource for building on Cloudflare, blending real-time official documentation with curated, battle-tested wisdom.

## 4. Key Features & Requirements

### 4.1. Multi-Source Information Synthesis
The agent must gather information from multiple sources and present a unified, coherent answer.
- **Requirement 4.1.1:** The agent MUST query the live, official Cloudflare Docs SSE server to retrieve real-time information.
- **Requirement 4.1.2:** The agent MUST query a curated D1 database for supplemental best practices, code examples, and known gotchas.
- **Requirement 4.1.3:** The architecture MUST be modular to support adding future data sources (e.g., Context7) with minimal refactoring.

### 4.2. Interactive Consultation
The agent must be able to engage in a dialogue to understand the user's problem fully before providing a solution.
- **Requirement 4.2.1:** The primary API for external interaction (e.g., for Custom GPTs) MUST be WebSocket-based to support real-time, back-and-forth conversation.
- **Requirement 4.2.2:** The agent's logic must include a "consultation phase" where it can ask clarifying questions based on the initial prompt.

### 4.3. Sandboxed Code Verification
The agent must be able to validate its own solutions.
- **Requirement 4.3.1:** The agent MUST have the ability to execute code in a secure, isolated sandbox environment.
- **Requirement 4.3.2:** The sandbox environment SHOULD be implemented using Cloudflare Workers for Platforms for native integration and security.
- **Requirement 4.3.3:** The agent's response package MUST indicate whether the provided code has been verified in the sandbox.

### 4.4. Continuous Improvement via Feedback Loop
The system must learn and improve over time.
- **Requirement 4.4.1:** An API endpoint MUST be provided for clients to submit feedback on the effectiveness of a solution.
- **Requirement 4.4.2:** This feedback MUST be stored and linked to the original query and response.
- **Requirement 4.4.3:** This feedback data should be used to curate and improve the content of the D1 knowledge base.

### 4.5. Developer Experience & Integration
The worker must be easily accessible to other tools and developers.
- **Requirement 4.5.1:** The worker MUST expose a public-facing API endpoint.
- **Requirement 4.5.2:** The worker MUST automatically generate an OpenAPI 3.1.0 schema for its public API.
- **Requirement 4.5.3:** All code MUST be professionally documented with file-level and function-level docstrings optimized for AI developer comprehension.

## 5. Target Audience

1.  **AI Developers (Primary):** LLMs and agents (like Gemini, custom GPTs) that need a reliable, expert tool for Cloudflare-related tasks.
2.  **Human Developers (Secondary):** Developers who can interact with the agent through chat interfaces or other custom tools.
