# Gemini vs. Codex: Contribution Comparison

This document compares the contributions made on the `feature/vision-refactor` branch (by Gemini) with the subsequent work done on the `feat/orchestrator-mcp` branch (by Codex), as detailed in `codex-contributions.md`.

---

## 1. Gemini's Contributions (`feature/vision-refactor`)

My work focused on the **foundational architectural refactoring and implementation** of the agent-based system. The primary goal was to build the core, functional engine for the new vision.

### Key Deliverables:
- **Architectural Shift:** Rewrote the `ChatSessionActor` from a simple request handler into a stateful agent capable of complex, multi-step reasoning.
- **Tool Implementation:** Created new, dedicated, and strongly-typed tool classes to replace the old, flawed `ToolService`:
    - `src/tools/browser.ts` (The `BrowserRender` class)
    - `src/tools/sandbox.ts` (The `SandboxTool` class)
- **Agent Logic:** Implemented the core **Plan -> Execute -> Synthesize** workflow directly within the `ChatSessionActor`, enabling it to create a research plan, run the necessary tools, and generate a final answer from the results.
- **Cleanup:** Removed the old `ToolService` (`src/tools/index.ts`) to eliminate the previous, less robust architecture.

**In short, my contribution was the *implementation* of the core agent engine.**

## 2. Codex's Contributions (`feat/orchestrator-mcp`)

The work on this branch, as described in the provided document, was focused on **strategic planning, documentation, and project management**. It built directly upon my foundational implementation without changing the runtime code.

### Key Deliverables:
- **Project Roadmap (`TODO.md`):** The primary contribution was the creation of a comprehensive `TODO.md` file. This document operationalizes the high-level product vision into a concrete, actionable execution plan with detailed tasks for areas like:
    - D1 Schema Finalization & DAL
    - Unified Routing & WebSocket Adapters
    - Advanced Agent Logic (e.g., RAG, clarifying questions)
    - Sandboxed Verification Workflows
    - Observability, Security, and Testing
- **Git Hygiene:** Established a new, clean branch (`feat/orchestrator-mcp`) based on my work, intended to provide a clear starting point for a pull request.
- **Code Parity:** Explicitly maintained functional code parity with my `feature/vision-refactor` branch, ensuring that the only addition was the planning document.

**In short, Codex's contribution was the *strategic roadmap* for completing the project.**

## Comparative Analysis

| Aspect                  | Gemini (`feature/vision-refactor`)                                | Codex (`feat/orchestrator-mcp`)                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nature of Work**      | Implementation & Architectural Refactoring                        | Planning & Scoping                                                    |
| **Code Impact**         | Substantial runtime code changes to actors and tools.             | No runtime code changes.                                              |
| **Primary Deliverable** | A functional, refactore`d ChatSessionActo`r and its tool classes. | A comprehensive `TODO.md` project plan.                               |
| **Relationship**        | Created the foundational engine.                                  | Created the detailed blueprint for building the rest of the product.  |

## Conclusion

The two sets of contributions are **complementary and sequential**.

- **Gemini** built the core, functional agent architecture.
- **Codex** took that architecture as a starting point and created the detailed project plan required to fully realize the product vision.

Codex's work is not a competing implementation but rather the strategic planning layer built directly on top of Gemini's foundational code.
