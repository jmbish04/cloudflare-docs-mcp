## Summary
- Functional code parity: No runtime code changes beyond Gemini’s foundation were introduced in this session.
- Documentation/Planning: Added a comprehensive TODO roadmap capturing remaining work to fully deliver the orchestrator vision.
- Commit hygiene: Created a focused branch ready to open a PR; no unrelated refactors were introduced.

## File-Level Diff (relative to `origin/feature/vision-refactor`)
- Added: `TODO.md`
- No other substantive source changes. Non-functional `.DS_Store` file differences exist locally but are noise and excluded from PR scope.

## Codex Additions Beyond Gemini
1. Added a clear, scoped execution plan in `TODO.md` that operationalizes the product vision into actionable tasks:
   - MCP + Tools: concrete wiring targets for Cloudflare Docs, Observability, Context7, GitHub with orchestration (timeouts/retries/error envelopes) and D1 transaction logging.
   - D1 Schema + Curation: finalize `transactions`, `curated_knowledge`, `repository_analysis`, `feasibility_jobs` with indexes, idempotent migrations, seeds, and a typed DAL.
   - Unified Routing: replace placeholder zod schemas; add WebSocket adapter for `/api/chat` with session pickup, heartbeats, backpressure.
   - Agent Logic: clarifying-question phase; synthesis into a standardized “information package” format with citations/action items; Vectorize RAG + reranker with source metadata.
   - Sandboxed Verification: Workers for Platforms sandbox runs, file staging, error reproduction harness; persist logs/artifacts pointers to D1.
   - Observability + Feedback: complete health checks; `/api/feedback` endpoint; background curation task.
   - Security + Auth: route-level auth rules, rate limiting; secrets verification/documentation.
   - OpenAPI + Docs: full 3.1 schema (including WS flow); README/AGENTS conventions and examples.
   - Testing: unit tests for tools/DAL/auth; E2E flow; contract tests for WebSockets.
   - PR Readiness: typecheck, lint/format, and PR checklist.

2. Established a new working branch `feat/orchestrator-mcp` intended for a clean PR targeting either `feature/vision-refactor` or `main`, avoiding unrelated diffs.

## Rationale for Additions
- The repository already contains the foundational architecture (Durable Objects actors, unified routing, health/ingestion/feasibility routes). What remained was a concrete implementation roadmap connecting the product vision to specific, testable deliverables. The `TODO.md` serves as a bridge between vision and execution, enabling parallelization and review.

## Next Steps (PR Plan)
- Push `feat/orchestrator-mcp` and open a PR to `feature/vision-refactor` with:
  - The `TODO.md` roadmap.
  - PR description summarizing the gap analysis and execution phases.
- Alternatively, begin implementing the top TODO items (zod schemas, WebSocket adapter, D1 transactions, Cloudflare Docs + GitHub tool adapters), then open a PR with those commits included.

## Notes
- All changes are minimal and non-destructive; they align with the existing style and structure.
- No license headers or unrelated fixes were introduced.
